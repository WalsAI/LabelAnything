LabelAnything

Models used:

Segment Anything (for semantic, instance or panoptic segmentation)
Grounding Dino (for object detection)
CLIP (for categorizing pictures)
Purpose of this repository:

Let's say you have a huge dataset unlabeled, uncategorized, basically just the pictures and that's all. Well given it could be pretty hard and tbh a tedious task to go through each picture label it for the task you need in order to train your machine learning model and then store it into a folder. Fortunately thanks to advancement in foundation models now this can be automatized using our beautiful repository.
It's easy to use, you just clone it, run it by giving it a path to a folder with pictures and then an output path and let it do its job.
That's it!
